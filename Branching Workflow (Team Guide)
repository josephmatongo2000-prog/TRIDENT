# 🧠 TRIDENT Development Workflow

To keep our codebase clean and collaborative, we follow a **branch-based workflow**.  
This ensures that new features, bug fixes, and releases are easy to manage.

## 🔱 Branch Naming Convention

| Type | Naming Pattern | Example |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Main Branch | `main` | Main stable release branch |
| Feature | `feature/<short-description>` | feature/payment-gateway |
| Bug Fix | `fix/<short-description>` | fix/settings-page-alignment |
| Hotfix (urgent) | `hotfix/<short-description>` | hotfix/api-crash |
| Release | `release/<version>` | release/v1.2.0 |

---

## 🌿 Workflow Steps

1. **Create a new branch** before starting any work:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/add-dashboard-ui
Make changes, test your code locally, and commit often:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Add animated dashboard UI with glassmorphism"
Push your branch to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git push origin feature/add-dashboard-ui
Open a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub:

Target branch → main

Add a meaningful title and short description

Request at least one reviewer

After approval, merge it safely through GitHub.

🧩 Code Style Rules
Use Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI for all front-end styling.

Keep each component modular in /components/ui.

Always use .env files for secrets, never commit them.

Test locally before pushing (npm run dev).

All commits should follow the format:

makefile
Copy code
type(scope): message

Examples:
feat(dashboard): add vibrant animated background
fix(auth): resolve login redirect issue
✅ Checklist Before Merging
 No console errors or warnings

 Proper component folder structure

 All routes work correctly

 Gradient background and UI animations function properly

 No .env or node_modules committed
